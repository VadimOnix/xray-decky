# Requirements Quality Checklist: Public Plugin Page (004-plugin-public-page)

**Purpose**: Validate completeness, clarity, consistency, and measurability of requirements for the public plugin page—i.e. "unit tests for the spec," not for implementation behavior.  
**Created**: 2026-02-14  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md) | **Plan**: [plan.md](../plan.md)

**Note**: Generated by `/speckit.checklist`. Each item asks whether the requirements are well-written and complete; it does not verify that the implementation works.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are the exact number and ordering of primary features specified (e.g. 4–6 items and which ones)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001; Plan mentions "4–6 feature blocks"]
- [ ] CHK002 Are responsive breakpoint(s) or viewport ranges explicitly defined (e.g. 375px mobile, 1280px desktop)? [Completeness, Spec §SC-004, §FR-008]
- [ ] CHK003 Are accessibility requirements specified for the public page (e.g. alt text, focus order, semantic structure, keyboard)? [Gap; Spec §FR-008 mentions alt/placeholders only]
- [ ] CHK004 Are requirements for the embed snippet content and format documented when embedding is in scope? [Completeness, Spec §FR-006; contracts/README]
- [ ] CHK005 Are loading or progressive-enhancement requirements stated for the no-JS / script-blocked case? [Completeness, Edge Cases, Plan]
- [ ] CHK006 Is the source of truth for plugin identity (name, description, features) documented (e.g. plugin.json, README)? [Completeness, Assumptions; data-model.md]

---

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK007 Is "visual design consistent with Steam Deck/SteamOS" defined with verifiable criteria (e.g. dark theme, accent colors, hierarchy)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-003, §User Story 2]
- [ ] CHK008 Is "sufficient quality for web display" for media specified (e.g. resolution, format, or max size)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-004, User Story 2 AC2]
- [ ] CHK009 Is "stable URL" defined so implementers know what stability means (e.g. path不变, no session params)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-005, §SC-003]
- [ ] CHK010 Are "common desktop and mobile viewports" enumerated or bounded (e.g. min/max widths)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-008, §SC-004]
- [ ] CHK011 Is "where the chosen hosting or format supports it" (FR-006) clarified so that in-scope embedding contexts are known? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-006]
- [ ] CHK012 Is "each major feature" (User Story 4 AC2) defined—i.e. which features require an image/icon? [Clarity, Spec User Story 4]

---

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK013 Do media requirements (hero + feature visuals) align across FR-004, SC-002, and User Story 4 acceptance scenarios? [Consistency, Spec]
- [ ] CHK014 Are no-secrets / no user-data requirements stated consistently in FR-007, SC-005, and User Story 3 AC3? [Consistency, Spec]
- [ ] CHK015 Do mobile-first and viewport requirements in the plan align with spec FR-008 and SC-004? [Consistency, Plan vs Spec]

---

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK016 Can SC-001 ("within 30 seconds") be objectively verified (e.g. by script or test protocol)? [Measurability, Spec §SC-001]
- [ ] CHK017 Is SC-002 ("as judged by a reviewer familiar with the platform") made repeatable (e.g. checklist or explicit style criteria)? [Measurability, Spec §SC-002]
- [ ] CHK018 Is "at least one common embedding context" in SC-003 specified or exemplified (e.g. Gist, iframe)? [Measurability, Spec §SC-003]
- [ ] CHK019 Are success criteria technology-agnostic and free of implementation detail? [Acceptance Criteria Quality, Spec Success Criteria]

---

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK020 Are requirements for zero-JS or script-blocked contexts explicitly stated (e.g. critical text in static markup)? [Coverage, Edge Cases, Plan]
- [ ] CHK021 Are requirements for failed or missing media explicitly stated (placeholders, alt, no broken layout)? [Coverage, Edge Cases, Spec §FR-008]
- [ ] CHK022 Are requirements for very old or restricted browsers stated (progressive enhancement, readable content)? [Coverage, Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK023 Are requirements for embedding when external images or scripts are blocked stated? [Coverage, Edge Cases]

---

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK024 Are fallback or recovery behaviors when media fails to load defined in requirements? [Edge Case, Spec §FR-008]
- [ ] CHK025 Are requirements for "web-appropriate" assets (resolution, format, file size) specified so implementers can verify FR-009? [Edge Case, Spec §FR-009, User Story 4 AC3]
- [ ] CHK026 Is the boundary between "optional" and "required" media (hero vs per-feature image) clear in the spec? [Edge Case, Spec §FR-004, User Story 4]

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK027 Are performance requirements (e.g. first contentful paint, load time) stated in the spec or explicitly referenced from the plan? [Non-Functional, Plan Performance Goals]
- [ ] CHK028 Are legal/usage-rights requirements for media (original, licensed, no infringement) clearly stated and verifiable? [Non-Functional, Spec §FR-009]
- [ ] CHK029 Are requirements for native HTML/CSS and minimal JS documented and traceable to acceptance? [Non-Functional, Plan, User constraints]

---

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK030 Is the assumption that "Steam Deck/SteamOS style" is derived from public branding (no proprietary kits) documented and validated? [Assumption, Spec Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK031 Are hosting/deployment expectations (e.g. stable URL via GitHub Pages or Gist) documented so implementers know the delivery target? [Dependency, Assumptions, quickstart.md]
- [ ] CHK032 Is the assumption that the plugin is Xray Decky only (no multi-plugin page) explicit and sufficient for scope? [Assumption, Spec Assumptions]

---

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK033 Is there any conflict between "single public page" (FR-001) and optional Gist/embed snippet (FR-006)? [Conflict check, Spec]
- [ ] CHK034 Are vague terms ("modern," "clear hierarchy," "recognizable") in FR-003 or User Story 2 quantified or given concrete criteria? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-003]

## Notes

- Check off items with `[x]` when the requirement aspect is satisfied in the spec/plan.
- Add inline comments or link to spec sections where requirements were added or clarified.
- Items marked [Gap] indicate likely missing requirements; address in spec or plan before implementation.
- Sequential IDs CHK001–CHK034; traceability references included per item where applicable.
